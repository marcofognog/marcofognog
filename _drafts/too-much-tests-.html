<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">And also, too much test can be as harmfull as not testing at all. The problems with not testing, we all now very well, but too much testing is a more complicated matter. About this, it's worth to quote Kent Beck:</span></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color:#999999;">“<span style="font-family:Lora, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><i>I get paid for code that works, not for tests, so my philosophy is to test as little as possible to reach a given level of confidence (I suspect this level of confidence is high compared to industry standards, but that could just be hubris). If I don’t typically make a kind of mistake (like setting the wrong variables in a constructor), I don’t test for it. I do tend to make sense of test errors, so I’m extra careful when I have logic with complicated conditionals. When coding on a team, I modify my strategy to carefully test code that we, collectively, tend to get wrong.”</i></span></span></span></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">I agee with him, “... test as little as possible to reach a level of confidence ...”. Now, paying enough atention we see he also doesn't test “all the fucking time”. There is stuff that is not worth to test, and once we agree on that, we can start to work on “what should we test?” matter. I know it can be difficul to draw the line between what should be tested and shouldn't, and maybe thats one of the situations where programming is not as exact as we thought. The level of confidence Kent Beck mentions it the culprit. Its an impossible thing to measure, but we all know it is there, I almost can see it when I am coding, and I can see it on the team. </span></span></span></p>
